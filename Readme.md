FoundryVTT module for the Imperium Maledictum system which handles Resolve in combat and helps tracking defeated enemies each round.

# Features

## Count how many enemies are defeated

After each round, module counts how many Troops, Elites and Leaders were defeated last round and sends summary to chat or notification. Why? To remember to add Superiority, of course! (p. 197 Imperium Maledictum Core Book)

## List Troop NPCs which are below Superiority treshold

List clickable tokens in chat message which belongs to Troop NPC whose Resolve is equal to or below the Superiority (p. 197 Imperium Maledictum Core Book). 

# Examples

Chat Message listing defeated enemies and lists Troop NPC with Resolve below Superiority treshold.
